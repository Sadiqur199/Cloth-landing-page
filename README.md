#### React Router
React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to define how your application's UI should change in response to the URL, enabling the creation of single-page applications (SPAs). <br/>

#### Tailwind Css
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly build user interfaces by applying pre-defined utility classes directly in your HTML markup. <br/>

#### React Animation(Aos)
AOS is a lightweight and user-friendly JavaScript library designed to enhance the visual appeal of web pages by animating elements when they come into view as the user scrolls. It simplifies the process of creating scroll-triggered animations, making it accessible for both developers and designers. <br/>

#### Deploy (Netlify)
Deploying a web application on Netlify is a straightforward process. Netlify is a popular cloud platform for hosting web applications, including static sites, single-page applications (SPAs), and serverless functions. It offers a user-friendly interface, easy integration with version control systems, automatic build and deployment processes, and a generous free tier for small to medium-sized projects. <br/>
